	<h3>For SAAS Builders</h3>

	<section >
		<p>Do you have a great product? Are you unable to fulfil Data safety requirements & convert Enterprise prospects? </p>

		<p>Are you struggling to keep up with growing compliance and security standards? </p>

		<p>Is your team unable to manage enterprise on-prem deployments? </p>
	</section>

	<section class="answer">
		We at Vessel, are building a state of the art Cloud platform, to let you solve these problems. Vessel will let deploy ship & run your applications in customers' private cloud environment and enable you to seamlessly manage them as you do in your current production environment. 
	</section>


	<h3>For Businesses & Enterprises</h3>

	<section>
		<p>Are you using more than handful of SAAS applications in your organisation?</p>

		<p>If yes - Is your CISO unhappy about hosting your organisation's data across different SAAS vendors and the risks involved?</p> 

		<p>Are you forced to use outdated  on-prem software, in place of popular SAAS apps, just to satisfy your security, data sovereignty & other obligations?</p> 
	</section>

	<section class="answer">
		We are on the same boat. Vessel will let you host your applications in your exclusive cloud, in any region and manage them the way you like. You will have complete control over your apps and their data. All while not spending insane amount of resources on-prem to be compliant with your IT requirements.
